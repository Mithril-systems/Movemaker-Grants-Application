### 8. Introduction to your project
Mithril addresses a 'structural divorce' in global trade between real economic value and the banking system's current risk-math, a substantial element of the $2.5tn trade finance gap. We are building a Move-native Commercial Operating System designed for 'High-Alpha/Low-Trust (HALT)' environments where high-margin goods are stifled by a lack of trust infrastructure that drives defensive risk-math.

Mithril explicitly rejects the legacy 'lending model', which monetizes duration but amplifies risk via credit, in favor of an 'infrastructure rent' model that monetizes 'velocity' and amplifies organic working capital’s profit-yield. By leveraging Hong Kong’s digital asset roadmap and the Stablecoins Ordinance, Mithril serves as the world’s 'Common Law Gateway' to the trade corridors of China and ASEAN, providing 'T-0 Settlement Finality' via our $MHKD stablecoin by replacing the 'expensive promise' of bank credit with the deterministic 'Physics of Cargo'.

### 9. What problem are you trying to solve, and why is it important?
Mithril addresses a Systemic-Analytic Failure where global banks, under the pressure of Basel III/IV Standardised Approach (SA) risk-weighting, have retreated from financing cargo to financing balance sheets. This problem is exacerbated by three primary frictions:

* **The Compliance Tax:** For unrated SMEs, the SA imposes a punitive 150% risk-weighting because legacy banking is legally blind to the value of physical cargo without a transparent, segregated settlement rail.
* **Operational Decay:** A 70% discrepancy rate in documentation triggers 10-15 days of 'Bank Lag'.
* **The Evaporation of Value:** While goods sit idle, capital is frozen and value evaporates (15-42% loss). Premium coffee beans end up in 'instant'; high-demand components like PCBs wind-up in port-side fire sales due to currency traps and bureaucratic friction.

Solving this is critical because these corridors represent a structural fact of global growth, yet remain underserved by a legacy banking system crying out for disruption by new tech.

### 10. What is your proposed solution?
Mithril is Asset-Backed Settlement Infrastructure that reifies Common Law principles into deterministic Move bytecode. It is designed to transform logistical data into immediate capital velocity, reclaiming the commercial surplus currently lost to the 'Friction Tax' in global trade.

* **Commercial (Friction Reclamation):** Utilizing Aptos Resource-Oriented Architecture to create 'Smart Safes' for the $MHKD stablecoin. By replacing the 'Expensive Promise' of bank credit with 100% upfront escrow, Mithril achieves T-0 Technical Finality. This allows SMEs to recover the 15-42% of value currently evaporated by "Bank Lag" and intermediary currency traps, directly augmenting the organic yield of their working capital.
* **Legal (The Quistclose Guard):** To satisfy Stablecoins Ordinance requirements for insolvency remoteness, the protocol reifies purpose-based trust via a Move-native 'Quistclose Guard'. We utilize the Move Prover to formally verify these resource structures, ensuring $MHKD remains legally and technically segregated for its intended purpose. This creates an institutional-grade "Safe Harbor" for capital, providing the architectural certainty required for high-value commodity corridors.
* **Technical (Triple-Lock Consensus):** Settlement is gated by the convergent verification of L1 Physical (IoT), L2 Documentary (ZK-eBL), and L3 Institutional (Attestation). It enforces 'Recency Alpha', where the state machine rejects any telemetry signal older than a configurable window (e.g. 12 hours). This ensures $MHKD only moves against fresh, objective physical data, effectively eliminating the "Oracle Problem" and providing the deterministic settlement required for high-velocity trade.

### 11. Any competitions?
Prior bank-focused projects like Marco Polo and Contour failed because they attempted to digitize 'Paper Promises' without resolving underlying credit friction. Mithril digitizes the cargo’s objective physical state. We transform logistical data signals into immediate Atomic Settlement, where the bytecode itself enforces the legal-commercial agreement.

### 12. Why Aptos?
Mithril requires Aptos’s Resource-Oriented Architecture to treat $MHKD as a 'Physical Digital Object'. We utilize Resource Accounts, Signer Capabilities, and specifically the Move Prover to formally verify the 'Quistclose Guard'. This allows us to mathematically secure insolvency-remoteness, providing the level of architectural certainty required for Hong Kong regulatory compliance and institutional adoption.

### 13. Team Background
* **Darius Azami. 42, Founder & System Architect:** First studying for the English Bar (Prince of Wales Scholar, Gray’s Inn), I hold a BA (Sussex), Masters (UCL), and PhD (Sussex). Following a period working in Employment, Public and Human Rights Law, I served on the Faculty of Diplomacy at Renmin University of China (2016-2022), entrenching an interest in the structural role of China in international trade and development. Since 2022, I have served as Head of Legal Affairs at an AI startup while cultivating a focus on the Move language to reconcile Mithril’s trinity: the commercial thesis, the legal framework, and the technical execution.
* **Technical Lead Partner (Recruitment Phase):** We are utilizing this application to identify a high-tier Move Engineer for a Milestone 2 'Proof of Logic' (PoL) Sprint. This $18,000 bounty serves as a 'long interview' for a potential Founding CTO, testing technical execution and commitment to the $MHKD settlement thesis before full-time onboarding.

### 14. If you have multiple founders, how did you meet?
Currently a solo founder. I am requesting talent and technical mentorship support from the Movemaker team and the Aptos Space (HK) community to identify a Move Engineer for the Milestone 2 Technical Execution Bounty.

### 15. How many projects have you worked on together?
Strategy, Legal, and Fundraising remain my domain; the Technical Lead will build the Proof of Logic, liaising closely with me to blend technical, commercial, and legal planning.

### 16. Is the founding team committed full-time to this project?
The Founder is fully committed to the strategic and legal launch. We are seeking a Lead Technical Partner to join full-time upon successful completion of the Milestone 2 simulation.

### 17. Where are the founders based?
Founder is currently based in Kaohsiung, allowing for immediate physical presence at Aptos Space (HK) for recruitment and the 2026 HKMA Sandbox engagement.

### 18. Budget proposal with milestones

| Milestone | Budget | Technical/Institutional Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Milestone 1: Institutional Foundation** | **$5,000** | **Formation of Mithril Systems (HK) Ltd:** Includes incorporation, mandatory CoSec, and formal IP assignment of v0.17 logic. |
| **Milestone 2: Technical & Legal Hardening** | **$33,500** | **Proof of Logic & Regulatory Whitepaper:** 8-week Move-native simulation ($18k) and a Structural Legal Opinion ($13.5k) validating the $MHKD architecture against Stablecoins Ordinance and Insolvency Remoteness requirements.|

### 19. Does the core team need office space support from Aptos Space (HK)?
Yes. Immediate presence is requested to facilitate recruitment, engage stakeholders, and prepare for the 2026 HKMA Sandbox application.

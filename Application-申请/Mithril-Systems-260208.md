### 7. Product Stage
MVP/Prototype (Forensic Blueprint Stage). The internal Mithril v0.17 Master Architecture Document (100+ pages) is available upon request for technical and legal due diligence.

### 8. Introduction to your project
Mithril addresses a 'structural divorce' in global trade between real economic value and the banking system's current risk-math, a substantial element of the $2.5tn trade finance gap. We are building a Move-native Commercial Operating System designed for 'High-Alpha/Low-Trust (HALT)' environments where high-margin goods are stifled by a lack of trust infrastructure that drives defensive risk-math.

Mithril explicitly rejects the legacy 'lending model', which monetizes duration but amplifies risk via credit, in favor of an 'infrastructure rent' model that monetizes 'velocity' and amplifies organic working capital’s profit-yield. By leveraging Hong Kong’s digital asset roadmap, Mithril serves as the world’s 'Common Law Gateway' to the trade corridors of China and ASEAN, providing 'T-0 Settlement Finality' by replacing the 'expensive promise' of bank credit with the deterministic 'Physics of Cargo'.

### 9. What problem are you trying to solve, and why is it important?
Mithril addresses a Systemic-Analytic Failure where global banks, under the pressure of Basel III/IV risk-weighting, have retreated from financing cargo to financing balance sheets. This problem is exacerbated by three primary frictions:

* **The Compliance Tax:** For unrated SMEs, a punitive 150% risk-weighting kills margins before a shipment leaves port. Legacy risk-math is legally blind to the value of physical cargo.
* **Operational Decay:** A 70% discrepancy rate in manual documentation triggering 10-15 days of 'Bank Lag' while intermediaries hunt for USD liquidity.
* **The Evaporation of Value:** While goods sit idle, capital is frozen and value evaporates (15-42% loss). Premium coffee beans end up in 'instant'; high-demand components like PCBs wind-up in port-side fire sales due to currency traps and bureaucratic friction.

Solving this is critical because these corridors represent a structural fact of global growth, yet remain underserved by a legacy banking system crying out for disruption by new tech.

### 10. What is your proposed solution?
Mithril is Asset-Backed Settlement Infrastructure that reifies Common Law principles into deterministic Move bytecode focused on the 'Physics of Cargo.'

* **Commercial:** Utilizing Aptos Resource-Oriented Architecture to create 'Smart Safes'. 100% upfront escrow achieves T-0 Technical Finality, enabling the recovery of the commercial surplus.
* **Legal (The Quistclose Guard):** To ensure structural compliance with HKMA standards, the protocol reifies purpose-based trust via a Move-native 'Quistclose Guard' to satisfy requirements for insolvency remoteness and client-asset protection.
* **Technical (Triple-Lock Consensus):** Settlement is gated by the convergent verification of L1 Physical (IoT), L2 Documentary (ZK-eBL), and L3 Institutional (Attestation), enforcing 'Recency Alpha' to ensure settlement only occurs on fresh data.

### 11. Any competitions?
Prior bank-focused projects like Marco Polo and Contour failed because they attempted to digitize 'Paper Promises' without resolving underlying credit friction. Mithril digitizes the cargo’s objective physical state. We transform logistical data signals into immediate Atomic Settlement, where the bytecode itself enforces the legal-commercial agreement.

### 12. Why Aptos?
Mithril requires Aptos’s Resource-Oriented Architecture to treat capital as a 'Physical Digital Object'. We utilize Resource Accounts, Signer Capabilities, and the Move Prover to formally verify the 'Quistclose Guard', ensuring insolvency-remoteness is mathematically secured, an architectural necessity for Hong Kong regulatory compliance.

### 13. Team Background
* **Darius Azami. 42, Founder & System Architect:** First studying for the English Bar (Prince of Wales Scholar, Gray’s Inn), I hold a BA (Sussex), Masters (UCL), and PhD (Sussex). Following a period working in Employment, Public and Human Rights Law, I served on the Faculty of Diplomacy at Renmin University of China (2016-2022), entrenching an interest in the structural role of China in international trade and development. Since 2022, I have served as Head of Legal Affairs at an AI startup while cultivating a focus on the Move language to reconcile Mithril’s trinity: the commercial thesis, the legal framework, and the technical execution.
* **Technical Lead Partner (Recruitment Phase):** We are utilizing this application to trigger Aptos Talent Support resources and have allocated an $18,000 Milestone 2 Technical Execution Bounty for a Move Engineer to execute the 'Proof of Logic' simulation.

### 14. If you have multiple founders, how did you meet?
Currently a solo founder. I am requesting talent and technical mentorship support from the Movemaker team and the Aptos Space (HK) community to identify a Move Engineer for the Milestone 2 Technical Execution Bounty.

### 15. How many projects have you worked on together?
Strategy, Legal, and Fundraising remain my domain; the Technical Lead will build the Proof of Logic, liaising closely with me to blend technical, commercial, and legal planning.

### 16. Is the founding team committed full-time to this project?
The Founder is fully committed to the strategic and legal launch. We are seeking a Lead Technical Partner to join full-time upon successful completion of the Milestone 2 simulation.

### 17. Where are the founders based?
Founder is currently based in Kaohsiung, allowing for immediate physical presence at Aptos Space (HK) for recruitment and the 2026 HKMA Sandbox engagement.

### 18. Budget proposal with milestones

| Milestone | Budget | Technical/Institutional Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Milestone 1: Institutional Foundation** | **$5,000** | **Formation of Mithril Systems (HK) Ltd:** Includes incorporation, mandatory CoSec, and formal IP assignment of v0.17 logic. |
| **Milestone 2: Technical & Legal Hardening** | **$33,500** | **Proof of Logic & Regulatory Whitepaper:** 8-week Move-native simulation ($18k) and a Structural Legal Opinion ($13.5k) validating against HKMA Sandbox requirements. |

### 19. Does the core team need office space support from Aptos Space (HK)?
Yes. Immediate presence is requested to facilitate recruitment, engage stakeholders, and prepare for the 2026 HKMA Sandbox application.
